s6-linux-utils - tiny Linux-specific utilities
----------------------------------------------

s6-linux-utils is a set of tiny Linux-specific utilities,
some performing well-known tasks such as mount and swapon,
other being nonstandard but typically useful for a s6-based
system. They have been optimized for simplicity and small size.
They were designed for embedded systems and other constrained
environments, but they work on any Linux system.

 Of particular interest in this package are the following
programs:
 - s6-ps, an independent ps implementation
